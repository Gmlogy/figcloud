      <strong>Applies to:</strong> FigCloud web properties and services, including the device authorization / login flow at
      <code>figcloud.com/calendar/login</code> (similar to <code>google.com/device</code>), used to sign in and connect a Google account to a Fig device.

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Mulberry Tech Group LLC, doing business as Fig / Fig Phones and FigCloud
      (“FigCloud,” “Fig,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use FigCloud services.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

    <h3>A. Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device authorization information</strong>: codes you enter (e.g., device code / user code) to link your account to a Fig device.</li>
      <li><strong>Support communications</strong>: messages you send us, and related contact information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information from Google Sign-In (when you choose to sign in with Google)</h3>
    <p>
      If you sign in with Google, we receive information necessary to authenticate you and connect your account to your device.
      Depending on the permissions (scopes) you approve, this may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic account info</strong> such as your Google account identifier, name, email address, and profile picture.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication tokens</strong> required to maintain your session and complete device linking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> request access to Google data beyond what is needed for authentication and the features you enable.
      The exact scopes will be shown on the Google consent screen.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Automatically collected information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Log and device data</strong>: IP address, browser type, timestamps, pages viewed, and diagnostic events.</li>
      <li><strong>Security signals</strong>: information used to detect fraud, abuse, or unauthorized access attempts.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong>: used for session management, security, and remembering preferences (where applicable).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authenticate you</strong> and complete the device authorization / linking process.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide and operate</strong> FigCloud features and services.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain security</strong>, prevent abuse, troubleshoot issues, and protect users and devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve</strong> performance and reliability (e.g., analyzing errors and usage patterns).</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate</strong> with you about support requests, updates, and service-related notices.</li>
      <li><strong>Comply with legal obligations</strong> and enforce our policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Google API Services: Limited Use</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        FigCloud’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
        <strong>Google API Services User Data Policy</strong>, including the <strong>Limited Use</strong> requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use Google user data only to provide or improve user-facing features that you request or enable,
        and we do not sell Google user data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>5) How we share information</h2>
    <p>We may share information only as described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (processors) that help us host, secure, operate, and support FigCloud (e.g., hosting, monitoring, customer support tools). They are required to protect the data and use it only for our instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong>: if required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security (including fraud prevention).</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers</strong>: if we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the service, maintain security, comply with legal obligations,
      and resolve disputes. Retention periods depend on the type of data and how it’s used.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access / update</strong>: You may request access to or correction of certain personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Disconnect Google</strong>: You can remove FigCloud’s access from your Google Account settings, which may stop Google-based features from working.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data</strong>: You may request deletion of your FigCloud account data (subject to legal and security retention needs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information.
      No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      FigCloud is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10) International users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access FigCloud from outside the country where our systems are located, your information may be processed in other countries
      which may have different data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post an updated version with a new “Last Updated” date.
