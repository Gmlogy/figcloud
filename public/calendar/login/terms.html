    <h1>FigCloud Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last Updated: February 2026</p>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> These Terms govern your use of FigCloud services, including the device authorization/login flow at
      <code>figcloud.com/calendar/login</code> that lets you sign in (including via Google) and connect your account to a Fig device.
    </div>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>1) Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form an agreement between you and Mulberry Tech Group LLC, doing business as Fig / Fig Phones and FigCloud
      (“FigCloud,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using FigCloud services (including completing a device login),
      you agree to these Terms and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be legally able to enter into a binding contract to use FigCloud. If you use FigCloud on behalf of an organization,
      you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>3) The FigCloud device login service</h2>
    <p>
      FigCloud provides a web-based device authorization experience (similar to <code>google.com/device</code>) that allows you to link an account
      to a Fig device by entering a code displayed on the device. You are responsible for keeping codes, credentials, and any connected accounts secure.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Accounts and third-party sign-in (Google)</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to sign in using Google, you authorize FigCloud to receive information from Google as described on the consent screen and in our
      <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You agree not to use another person’s Google account (or any account) without permission.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to bypass or defeat authentication, authorization, or security controls.</li>
      <li>Use FigCloud to engage in fraud, abuse, harassment, or unlawful activity.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the service (including load testing or scanning) except as explicitly permitted by us in writing.</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code or underlying systems, except where prohibited by law.</li>
      <li>Use automated means to access the service in a way that exceeds reasonable request rates or violates robots/exclusion standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Service changes and availability</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify, suspend, or discontinue FigCloud (in whole or in part) at any time. We try to keep the service available and reliable,
      but we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Suspension or termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access to FigCloud if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, pose a security risk,
      or if required to comply with law. You may stop using FigCloud at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      FigCloud and its content, software, and trademarks are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable laws.
      Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use FigCloud for its intended purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      FIGCLOUD IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FIGCLOUD WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
      EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF FIGCLOUD.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FigCloud and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities,
      damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your misuse of FigCloud or violation of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to conflict of laws principles,
      unless applicable law requires a different governing law.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the updated Terms and revise the “Last Updated” date.
      Your continued use of FigCloud after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>
